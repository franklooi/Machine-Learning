The people who bet against the odds by picking the least popuar numbers (eg: 1,2,3,4) will split their winnings with less people. At any given week, we should attempt the lottery as many time as possible to choose a non-popular combination. This will ensure we win a larger amount of money (if and only if we win). If we got a common combination, we could keep it and continue drawing numbers to get an uncommon combination."

This is because neural networks are trained and tested on existing data. If there was no way of representing the problem for computers to understand, neural network would not work. This is unlike human intuition or expert diagnosis, which is what the neural network is somewhat based on. \n",

    "I would buy the product if I merely need to be able to make good classification or regression predictions without understanding *why* the predictions were good. This is because there are too many hidden units (a trillion) that goes behind the prediction that makes explaining the prediction nearly impossible. We can ask why the product predicted things a certain way but would not get an isolated answer as to why, and therefore cannot act to change the predicted outcome if they were unfavorable to us (eg: predicting a cyber attack without knowing the exact source and nature). Without knowing the mechanics behind the predictions, this neural network model are hence not considered very generalizable. This means that beyond the test data, we always run the risk of having a model that is overfitted or underfitted when making predictions. The hardest thing is that we won't be able to know which exact parameter to tweak during supervised learning, such as bias. I would justifiably purchase the product to the extent that the predicted outcome is more important than the explanation process."
